Bonobo Git Server is an open source repository and file tracking service, kind of like github. Pepperdine customized it to fit its own needs and we were a part of the team that implemented features to do that.

In the year I spent with the Pepperdine Application Development team I was assigned to work on updating the bonobo git server to version 7.0 with 2 other interns. 
We were given some frontend tasks like removing one view and adding it as part of another view, or even using Javacript, Jquery, and Ajax to dynamicaly add service accounts and dependencies(Third party software) as well as being able to edit and delete them. We also had to update the model and the controller to account for these changes. We also worked on a test project that tests the features we added to the project. 

We started by having a meeting discussing our goals for the year and the project that we would work on. We then had to write it down clearly in a google document to make sure we understand everything.

We had 2 Code reviews where I barely needed any pointers due to following all the guidelines set by the lead developer and my mentor. Some of these contained case issues like using camelcase for C# functions or having useless dead code. I however assisted a lot in helping the other interns with their code issues there.
